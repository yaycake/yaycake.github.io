## Le Wagon Chengdu

opened in 2017 in Chengdu, Sichuan. Le Wagon is a globally ranked #1 coding bootcamp; I became involved with Le Wagon Chengdu as a creative entrepreneur and continue to help grow the community today.


## UX & UI Design Sprints

I taught the first product design sprint for the very first batch of students in Chengdu in 2017, covering product development, creating user stories, zoning & mockups in Sketch, and prototyping with Invision and/or Marvel.


## Projects & Demo Day

While I myself went on to attend and graduate from the following batch so I could improve how I work and communicate with teams of developers, I continue facilitating the product sprint for Le Wagon Chengdu and often mentor student projects on the front end.

## Startup Weekend

I am also involved in Chengdu's local Startup Weekend conference and mentor through product design at their hackathon events, working with local creative entrepreneurs and software engineers to shapen and sharpen their product ideas.
