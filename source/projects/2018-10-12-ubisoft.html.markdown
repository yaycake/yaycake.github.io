## Ubisoft Shanghai

is the second largest Chinese development studio, and Ubisoft 's second largest studio behind Ubisoft Montreal.
Held annually in Shanghai, China, ChinaJoy or China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference is a digital entertainment expo is the largest gaming and digital entertainment exhibition held in China and Asia.

WeChat is the social, financial, and cultural infrastructure that everyday China relies on.

With the advent of WeChat Mini Programs, Ubisoft Shanghai shared a vision of a community united through the excitement and passion of China Joy.

##The User Stories

Users would be able to book demos, enter in lucky draw lotteries for limited edition prizes, share event posts, or look up and stream scheduled live shows and other events.

As for Ubisoft Shanghai, they would be able to collect information on attendees, and be able to reach out and connect the China community to their official WeChat page.

## The Process

I worked with the Ubisoft Shanghai creative, marketing, and mobile development teams to draft UX workflows, design UI elements, and provide some front-end consulting for the WeChat framework.

## The Deliverables

I provided a full PDF UX map with labelled Sketch artboards & 3 edit rounds. I also provided all UI components and unique graphics specific to the Mini Program (i.e. icons for each of Ubisoft's games, the lucky draw backdrop).
