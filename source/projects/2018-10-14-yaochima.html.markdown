## Discover Places To Eat

Yaochima is a WeChat Mini Program that helps you discover, explore, and find local Chengdu eats with a few shakes of your phone.

## The Challenge

Local Chinese apps like Dianping or Meituan overwhelm users with endless and infinite possibilities of where to eat. In a city like Chengdu, where it's easy to drown in hot-pot or skewers, Yaochima helps free you from the paradox of choice.

## The Solution

With each shake of your phone, Yaochima shows you a lottery of nearby restaurants within walking distance. Each result displays cuisine type and price range: if you don't like and lock either parameter and shake again, the cuisine and price range choices are filtered out of future results to truly help you narrow down and  make a quick and efficient decision.

## Local Spice

To localize our mini program idea, we recorded, edited, adn added Sichuan exclamations to accompany each shake.
