## WeChat Stickers

are a fun, witty, and cultural treasure trove for everyday social interactions. From private conversations to group banter, it is a badge of coolness and hilarity in the digital community when you produce the perfect sticker at the perfect time.

## The Problem

WeChat users discover stickers through adding them from a conversation where it's posted. When you're browsing other kinds of content like sticker galleries, websites, blogs, or Twitter, it's a challenge to be able to add the gif to your WeChat collection due to its size, format, or cross-app compatibility.

## The Solution

We built a sticker machine by calling Giphy's API. I designed the logo and coded the front end for maximum sticker-enjoyment: big, shiny mason grid layout to search and highlight the variety of different sticker results in a dynamic way. Clicking on the sticker brings you to preview the sticker alone, and longpressing allows you to add it to your personal WeChat sticker gallery.
