## I Freak What I Got

As a former marketing manager and event producer, my shift towards User Experience was a no-brainer.

I bring a useful set of skills to shaping a product-- from macro-level creative strategies to how solid brand strategies can reproduce authentic brand & campaign experiences.

## Brand Strategy

My digital marketing and management background provide a holistic perspective on how to discover, shape, and implement a cohesive and consistent brand strategy.

I also consult re-branding processes: discovery and research to modernize, stylize, or profiling your target audience.

## Creative Design

I use Adobe Illustrator for illustrations, graphic design, and iconography. While I am familiar with Adobe XD and Figma, I mostly use Sketch for UX wireframes and product design mockups.

## Execution & Code

I work in HTML/CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and Markdown. Past WeChat Mini Program projects were coded in MINA (native WeChat framework), and include wxcss and wxml.
